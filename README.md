# Recipe_Finder

As I am practicing using the AWS services, I decided to build a static website on an S3 bucket, which would work as a recipe finder, containing all the baby friendly recipes that I introduced in a previous repository.


## Create bucket

First, I create my bucket, enable static web hosting and public access, and assign the appropriate permissions.

## Upload html file as an object

Moving on, I upload the appropriate file into my bucket.

## Test the website

I locate the url and test my website.
